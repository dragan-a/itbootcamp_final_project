ITBootcamp final project

As one of the ITBootcamp trainee I had the assignment to automatize test for this application: https://vue-demo.daniel-avellaneda.com/.
Goal was to cover some of the most important test cases such as login and signup with valid and invalid credentials, logout,
then creating, editing and deleting cities, language change, editing profile etc.

Automation test was created using Selenium and TestNG and also some of the input data were provided by Faker library.
Web elements were selected mostly by id (if there was one), by classname and by xpath.
Project is divided in Pages and Tests.
